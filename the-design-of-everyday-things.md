# The Design of Everyday Things

Don Norman

## Chapter one: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things

- The two most important characteristics of good design are **discoverability** and **understanding**.
    - Discoverability: Is it possible for me to ascertain what actions are possible with this product, and how/when/where are they performed?
    - Understanding: **how** is the product meant to be used? What do its settings and controls etc mean?
    - Example given for a failure in **discovery** is a confusing push/pull door. If the hinge to a large glass door is invisible, and there is no push plate/pull lever etc, there is very little a user can do to ascertain what actions are possible. Does the door slide? Is it automated? Is it push/pull?
    - A failure in **understanding** is a vastly overcomplicated home appliance. It sits there with hundreds of settings and knobs, yet 99% of users never understand what they do - they just pick one setting and use it every day.

- Great design produces pleasurable experiences - this determines how fondly people remember their interactions. When discovery and understanding lead to a feeling of control and mastery, a user is hooked. When it leads to confusion and frustration, the design has not done its job.

### Fundamental Principles of Interaction

- Affordances, Perceived Affordances & Signifiers
    - Affordances represent the possible ways in which a user can interact with a product: e.g. you can push a door open.
    - Signifiers are explicit signs, labels and images placed in the world to signify what these affordances are: e.g. a `push` sign on said door.
    - A perceived affordance is an affordance that is clearly visible before interaction with an entity begins - these can be ambiguous, as it may be up to user interpretation: e.g. a wooden door with handle doesn't need a 'push/pull' sign, its perceived affordance is that it will function as a normal door. An incorrectly perceived affordance may be a user walking into a door, assuming it to be automated and therefore to be open for them.
- Mapping
    - Relationship between two entities, especially when control is involved. Spacial correspondence is important; wheel turns clockwise to turn car right, car mirror control presses down to move mirror down, top left switch in group lights up top left group of lights.
- Feedback
    - Feedback **must** be immediate! A user must be told that the system is working on their request, or at least understands it has been interacted with. *Note: too much feedback can be annoying*
- Conceptual Models
    - A highly simplified, high-level explanation of how something works. It doesn't have to be complete or fully accurate, as long as it is useful!
