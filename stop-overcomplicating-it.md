# Stop Overcomplicating It

[First Round Review](https://review.firstround.com/stop-overcomplicating-it-the-simple-guidebook-to-upping-your-management-game)
A summary of work by Russ Laraway

## Why are managers failing?

- Style over substance
    - People are too focused on fancy frameworks and unique 'leadership-y' (sic) things to bring that make them and their environment unique, often missing the basics of management that work everywhere.
    - Charisma is overrated:
        - ```successful managers brush and floss, while the charisma folks are the teeth whiteners. The brush and flossers do the little things every day that lead to the employee being successful```
        - Charisma is irrelevant - if an aligned result is delivered, and the people on the team are enabled to be successful, the manager has done their job.


## The system for choosing managers is broken

```The activities that make you successful as a manager look nothing like the activities that make you successful as an individual contributor.```

- Instead of defaulting to the longest-tenured or the best individual contributor, orgs must get specific about leadership behaviours (the review uses [this rubric](https://coda.io/@they-win-you-win/big-3-leadership-assessment-scorecard) as an example).

## The 'Big 3'

Three specific management behaviours most closely aligned w. employee engagement: direction, coaching and career.

### Direction
Good managers ensure every team member knows exactly what is expected and when.

Four elements of direction:

- Purpose
    - Synonymous with mission - the **reason** the company and team exists. Who do we serve? Why do we matter?
- Vision
    - The 'big-picture' goal we're working to achieve. Quantifiably measured, even if it's years in the future.
- OKRs/Goals
    - Quarterly or annual goals that get us closer to achieving the teams **Vision**. With clarity around goals for the immediate future, a manager is in the position to facilitate autonomy and clear the path for their team to achieve.
- Prioritization (ruthlessly)
    - Creating a distinction between a task list and priorities is a matter of subtraction - removing workstreams that don't matter to the business. Focus on a small number of things and be effective at them. **Do not confuse volume of work with impact.**
    
### Coaching
Good managers coach people towards both short and long term success, helping them understand what they should continue doing and how they can improve.

### Career
Good managers invest in their people's careers in a way that considers their long-term goals and aspirations, beyond the next promotion and the current company.
